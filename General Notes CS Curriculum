# PRECONDITIONS = assumptions about your code
# for example, would need to enter particular value or works under certain conditions

# RETURN NONE = acceptable situation, purpose of returning none is to omit a return value

# RECIPES OF A FUNCTION = 
# 1 - EXAMPLES - Figure out arguements you want to include and what to return
# 2 - TYPE CONTRACT - the types of information to be handled and types of values, ie. int, float, string
# 3 - HEADER - a meaningful header can mean its easier to read ie. Def days_difference(day_start, day desired):
# 4 - DESCRIPTION - use the docstring """ to start and explain the purpose. when using help this will appear in the help call for function
# 5 - BODY - the actual function details
# 6 - TEST - use some examples and what the outcome would be, check and revise


# Notes about calling functions---
# the function definition introduces a new variable that refers to a function object
# the parameter is the item int eh parentheses that is being used as input to the function
# the variabels within the function are local variables only used in teh function and not sent out of it, purpose is to calculate intermediate values before return
# function calls tell python to
